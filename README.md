In this project, let's build a **Rock Paper Scissors** by applying the concepts we have learned till now.

### Refer to the image below:

### Set Up Instructions

<details>

- Download dependencies by running `npm install`
- Start up the app using `npm start`
</details>

### Completion Instructions

<details>
<summary>Functionality to be added</summary>
<br/>

The app must have the following functionalities

- When you click on the **Rules** button, it should trigger a popup, and rules image should be displayed
- Initially, the score displayed should be `0`
- The App is provided with `choicesList`. It consists of a list of choice objects with the following properties in each choice object

  |   Key    | Data Type |
  | :------: | :-------: |
  |    id    |  String   |
  | imageUrl |  String   |

- When any of the three buttons (i.e Rock, Paper, Scissors) is clicked, then the [Game Results View](https://assets.ccbp.in/frontend/content/react-js/rock-paper-scissors-lg-game-results-output.png) should be displayed
- In the Game Results View, the opponent choice should be generated randomly among these three buttons (i.e Rock, Paper, Scissors)
- When the **Rock** button is clicked, then the rock image should be displayed as your choice in the Game Results View
- When the **Paper** button is clicked, then the paper image should be displayed as your choice in the Game Results View
- When the **Scissors** button is clicked, then the scissors image should be displayed as your choice in the Game Results View

    <br/>

  - Game result based on choices

    - When your choice is **paper** and the opponent choice is **rock**, then the result will be `YOU WON`
    - When your choice is **scissors** and the opponent choice is **rock**, then the result will be `YOU LOSE`
    - When your choice is **rock** and the opponent choice is **paper**, then the result will be `YOU LOSE`
    - When your choice is **scissors** and the opponent choice is **paper**, then the result will be `YOU WON`
    - When your choice is **rock** and the opponent choice is **scissors**, then the result will be `YOU WON`
    - When your choice is **paper** and the opponent choice is **scissors**, then the result will be `YOU LOSE`
    - When your choice and the opponent choice match, then the result will be `IT IS DRAW`

    </details>

- When the result is `YOU WON`, then the score should be incremented by one
- When the result is `IT IS DRAW`, then there shouldn't be any change in the score
- When the result is `YOU LOSE`, then the score should be decremented by one
- When the **PLAY AGAIN** button is clicked, then the [Playing View](https://assets.ccbp.in/frontend/content/react-js/rock-paper-scissors-lg-playing-output.png) should be displayed

### Quick Tips

<details>
<summary>Click to view</summary>
<br>

- You can use `Math.random()` function to get a random number (float value) in range 0 to less than 1 (`0 <= randomNumber < 1`)

  ```
  Math.random()
  ```

- You can use `Math.floor()` function that returns the **largest integer less than or equal to a given number**

  ```js
  console.log(Math.floor(5.95)); // output: 5
  ```

</details>

### Important Note

<details>
<summary>Click to view</summary>

<br/>

- You can use **reactjs-popup** for displaying the modal
- `RiCloseLine` icon from `react icons` can be used for the **close** button at `React Popup`

**The following instructions are required for the tests to pass**

- **Styled Components** should be used for styling purposes
- The Page should consist of three HTML button elements with `data-testid` attribute values as **rockButton**, **scissorsButton** and **paperButton** respectively
- In Game Results View, the page should consist of an HTML image element with alt as **your choice** and src as URL for your choice image
- In Game Results View, the page should consist of an HTML image element with alt as **opponent choice** and src as URL for opponent choice image
- **Roboto** should be applied as `font-family` for **Score** value

> ### _Things to Keep in Mind_
>
> - All components you implement should go in the `src/components` directory.
> - Don't change the component folder names as those are the files being imported into the tests.
> - **Do not remove the pre-filled code**
